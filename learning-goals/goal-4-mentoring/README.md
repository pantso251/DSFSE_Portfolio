# Goal 4: Brief Mentoring of a Less Experienced Teammate

**Category:** Knowledge quality, communication, social aspects

---

## 🎯 Original Goal Statement

**Goal:** During the project, I want to support our less data-acquainted team member in understanding and executing specific technical steps (e.g. basic cleaning or basic mapping). By doing this I will help our team not fall behind or lack understanding of the workflow.

**How:** Creating reproducible steps together with clear documentation of choices and scripting as well as providing guidance throughout the project when advised.

---

## 📋 Background

Our team consisted of three members with varying levels of technical experience in data science and Python programming. One team member had limited experience with:
- Python data manipulation (Pandas, GeoPandas)
- Geospatial analysis workflows
- API integration and data extraction
- Git/GitHub collaboration
- Arc Online maps and story map creation

To ensure team success and knowledge sharing, I took on a mentoring role to help bridge these knowledge gaps.

## 🎓 Mentoring Approach

### Guiding Principles
1. **Learning by doing** - Guide through hands-on tasks rather than lecturing
2. **Clear documentation** - Write code with extensive comments
3. **Reproducible workflows** - Create step-by-step notebooks they could follow
4. **Patience and encouragement** - Build confidence through small successes
5. **Ask questions** - Encourage understanding, not just copying code

## 💻 Specific Mentoring Activities
 Examples:

During the first two weeks I dedicated more than 2 hrs split in half hour sessions to mentor my teammate. We started with basic pandas following through the course's tutorials and materials and then we followed with a short datacamp tutorial i had given access through the Geoscripting course. We then created a new ipynb where team mate could reproduce the basic initial cleaning of the dataset in their own free time. After that I showed them how to use .describe(), .info() functions of pandas with practical hands-on experience in our dataset. On their own they learned how and where to use .head() and .tail() which made me feel proud to engage with this mentoring activity. Also, basic geopandas functionality was shown but not thoroughly impemented within the project. 

During the third and final week of the project due to time limitations I couldn't establish a mentoring session with my teammate, but I explained to them how we produce and understand a density map in Arc Online Map Viewer. To achieve this we first explored together as a whole team basic functionality of GeoDA software. I later then showed my teammember how to create a group in Arc Online, import and view our csv file as a layer. We created a density map together and then they made the same with different symbology or their own. As our team started producing correlation graphs, I showed how to do so with matplotlib in their own jupyter notebook. I also provided a brief explanation of basic folium interactive plotting which they found really interesting.

 In general i am very happy with the progress they did throughout the project and feel very proud in my ability to break down complex issues into small-sized bites for better understanding.

### Impact on Team
- **Prevented bottlenecks:** Mentoring kept the team moving forward even when things took an undesirable turn
- **Knowledge distribution:** Spreading knowledge helped the team work more cohesively with proper task delegation
- **Team morale:** Building teammate confidence improved collaboration

### Personal Growth
**What I learned from mentoring:**
- Teaching concepts deepened my own understanding
- Developed communication and patience skills
- Learned to explain technical concepts in accessible ways

## 📝 Conclusions

### On the Results
- Successfully supported teammate in understanding technical areas
- Team workflow remained cohesive despite varying skill levels
- Documentation and clear comments proved essential for knowledge transfer

### On Goal Accomplishment

**What worked well:**

✅ Created reproducible, well-documented code that teammate could follow  
✅ Provided guidance when requested without taking over tasks  
✅ Built teammate's confidence through incremental learning  
✅ Team did not fall behind due to skill gaps  

**What could be improved:**
Due to time limitations I was faced
- Could have established more structured mentoring schedule if time allowed
- Could have created more comprehensive documentation/tutorials
- Could have checked for understanding more systematically

**Challenges faced:**
- Limited team size (3 vs. 5) meant less time for dedicated mentoring
- Balancing own learning goals with teaching responsibilities

**Did I achieve my goal?**  
I can proudly say that i achieved my mentoring goal. Although they were more part to still be addressed we made significant improvement in understanding and wiritng basic Python code along with basic map creation and visualization

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### About Mentoring
1. **Teaching deepens understanding** - Explaining concepts forced me to understand them more deeply
2. **Patience matters** - Everyone learns at different paces
3. **Questions reveal gaps** - Encouraging questions helps identify misunderstandings early

### About Collaboration
1. **Diverse skill levels are normal** - Real-world teams always have knowledge gaps
2. **Knowledge sharing benefits everyone** - Mentoring strengthened the whole team
3. **Communication is a skill** - Technical knowledge means nothing if you can't explain it

### Personal Development
- Improved ability to explain technical concepts clearly
- Learned to write more accessible, educational code
- Developed empathy for learners at different stages

**Reflection:** This goal reminded me that data science is not just about technical skills—it's also about collaboration, communication, and lifting others up. The best way to truly understand something is to teach it to someone else. Through this i got to sharpen my soft skills as well as techincal skills, preparing me for collaborative work environments and task in my future geospatial career.
