# Visual Results - Beach Pollution Analysis

This folder contains the key visualizations from the project, explaining beach pollution patterns in Italy.

---

## 📊 Visualization Overview

All figures are designed to be accessible to non-technical audiences including policymakers and students.

**Note:** Most of the maps produced are in screenshots due to ArcGIS web feature layers not being able to be shared to other users.

## Visualizations

[ADD: For each screenshot/map in this folder, add a description of:
- What the visualization shows
- Key findings
- Explanation for policymakers/non-technical audiences]

---

## 📌 Notes

- All maps created using ArcGIS Pro/ArcGIS Online and Plotly
- Data represents crowdsourced beach reviews and ratings
- Density calculations show concentration patterns, not absolute pollution measurements
